# Interac E-Transfer (Canada)

Interac is a leading Canadian payment network that facilitates secure, real-time transactions between bank accounts. It offers multiple payment options, including **Interac e-Transfers**.

**Interac e-Transfe**r allows users to send and receive money directly between bank accounts using their email linked with the bank account. It provides a fast, secure, and convenient alternative to traditional payment methods, accessible through most Canadian banks' online and mobile banking platforms.

### **Paysecure’s Interac product suite enables merchants to initiate:**

- **Payins:** Consumers can choose Interac e-Transfer to transfer funds from their bank account, through their bank’s app or website.
- **Payouts:** Facilitate real-time disbursements directly to consumers' accounts.

## Concepts

- **Payment Method Codes:**
    - Payin → `INTERAC-ETRANSFER`
    - Payout → `PAYOUT-INTERAC-ETRANSFER`
- **Reference Details:** Payments require a deposit email plus a **security question and answer** (unless the customer has Auto-Deposit enabled in case of payout).
- **Expiry:** PayIn requests remain valid for **30 days minimum** (merchant can extend but not shorten).
- **Auto-Deposit:** Customers, with this setting enabled, receive payouts instantly; otherwise they enter security question and answer to approve the payout request.

### **Key Steps**

### **How it works**

Interac e-Transfer enables merchants with capability to support easy collection from customers. Merchants can initiate payment requests to provide secure, efficient, and flexible options for collecting payments from customers.

![](/img/interac2.png)

1. **Initiate Request**
    - Merchant calls `/purchases` API.
    - Must specify `INTERAC-ETRANSFER` as payment method, customer’s email, and amount.
2. **API Response**
    - Returns deposit email + security question/answer.
    - The merchant then has 2 options to share the payment instructions with the customer:
        - Redirect the end-user to the checkoutURL present in the API response, where the customer is shown the relevant payment instructions required to make Interac payments. ***If this option is employed, the user would be redirected to the appropriate success or failure redirect URL.***
        - Retrieve the PayIn details in the response JSON (as shown below) to create a webpage within the merchant’s IT estate, and show to user the PayIn instruction
    
    ```json
    "payInDetails": {
      "name": "INTERAC E-TRANSFER",
      "emailAddress": "deposit@choicepay.ca",
      "secretQA": "q1172202",
      "secretAnswer": "a1172202"
    }
    ```
    
3. **Customer Completes Payment**
    - Logs into online/mobile banking.
    - Enters deposit email, amount, and security Q/A.
    - Authorizes transfer.
4. **Confirmation**
    - Paysecure sends webhook with status.
    - Merchant can also poll `GET /purchases/{purchaseId}`.
    - Merchant’s Interac balance is updated on success.

## **Payout flows**

### **How it works**

Paysecure offers the ability to make payouts to customers', individuals', or businesses' bank accounts using **`PAYOUT-INTERAC-ETRANSFER`** payout method. Whether for refunds, rewards, or other types of disbursements, the Payouts API ensures efficient and reliable transactions, supporting real-time fund transfers and comprehensive transaction tracking over Interac e-transfers.

- **Initiate Payout Request:** The merchant calls the Paysecure `/payout/` API. This request includes the customer’s email address or mobile number, the amount to be transferred, and an optional message.
- **Customer Deposits Funds (Optional):** The customer with auto-deposit turned off, will have to follows the link received from Interac over their email and follow the instructions to receive the funds into their account. **For customers with auto-deposit turned on, the funds will be received instantaneously.**
    
    <aside>
    
    **Security Question and Answer:** for manual deposit of the funds, ie. customer having their auto-deposit off, the merchant can share the security question and answer on their cashier page or via the email. These instructions are needed for customer to approve the receiving of the payout/funds. 
    
    </aside>
    
- **Confirm Payout Completion:** Upon successful deposit, the merchant will receive the webhook with transaction info and the status. Merchant can verify the transaction status through `GET /getpayout/{PayoutId}`  API.
- **Update Merchant’s Account:** The merchant’s balance over **INTERAC-ETRANSFER** is adjusted upon a successful payout transaction.

## Edge Case Handling

- **Incorrect/Missing Security Answer** → Funds not deposited until corrected; refunded if not claimed.
- **Expired Request** → Payments after expiry are auto-refunded.
- **Underpayment/Overpayment** → Handled as per global rules (partial = pending, extra = refunded).
- **Auto-Deposit Off** → If the Customer has auto-deposit off, the customer has to manually accept the payout.
