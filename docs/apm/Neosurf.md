# Neosurf (Global)

## Overview

**Neosurf** is a globally accepted prepaid payment method that enables customers to pay online using vouchers or a MyNeosurf account. It is especially popular forÂ **digital goods, gaming, and entertainment services**Â where customers want secure and anonymous payment options.

With Paysecure, merchants can:

- **PayIns (collections):**Â Customers pay with Neosurf vouchers or their MyNeosurf account.
- **Refunds:**Â Merchants can return funds to theÂ **original voucher/MyNeosurf account**Â used for payment.
- **Payouts (disbursements):**Â Merchants send funds to a customerâ€™s MyNeosurf account (email-linked).

## Concepts

- Payin: `NEOSURF`

- **Fraud reduction:**Â No chargebacks since funds are prepaid.
- **Higher conversion:**Â Simple voucher entry reduces cart abandonment.
- **Customer privacy:**Â Anonymous option is attractive in digital industries.

## Payin Flow (Voucher / MyNeosurf)

**Step 1: Customer Checkout**

- Customer adds items to cart â†’ selectsÂ **Neosurf**Â as payment method.
- Merchant backend calls Paysecureâ€™sÂ `/purchases`Â API with:
    - `paymentMethod = NEOSURF`
    - Customer info (email, country, etc.)
    - Purchase info (currency, amount, product details).

**Step 2: API Response**

- Paysecure returns:
    - `purchaseId`Â (internal reference)
    - `checkoutUrl`Â (hosted Neosurf page)
    - InitialÂ `status = payment_in_process`

**Step 3: Redirect to Checkout**

- Merchant redirects the customer to theÂ `checkoutUrl`.
- On the Neosurf hosted page, customer chooses:
    - **Voucher option**Â â†’ Enters voucher code (10 digits, sometimes with PIN).
    - **MyNeosurf option**Â â†’ Logs in with registered email and authorizes payment.

**Step 4: Voucher Validation**

- Neosurf validates voucher/account:
    - Authenticity of code/login.
    - Available balance.
    - Expiry status.
- If valid & sufficient â†’ balance debited instantly.

**Step 5: Payment Confirmation**

- Customer sees confirmation screen.
- Neosurf sends result back to Paysecure.
- Paysecure updates transaction â†’ sends webhook to merchant:
    - `purchase.paid`Â (success),
    - `purchase.error`Â (invalid/expired code, insufficient funds),
    - `purchase.cancelled`Â (customer abandoned).

**Step 6: Merchant Update**

- Merchant receives webhook payload (purchaseId, status, amount).
- Backend updates order status accordingly.
- Customer is redirected toÂ `success_redirect`Â orÂ `failure_redirect`Â page.

## Refund Flow (Back to Original Source)

**Step 1: Merchant Initiates Refund**

- Merchant callsÂ `/purchases/{purchaseId}/refund`Â API
- Required fields:
    - OriginalÂ `purchaseId`

**Step 2: Paysecure Validation**

- Paysecure checks:
    - If original transaction is refundable.
    - If requested refund â‰¤ remaining refundable balance.

**Step 3: Refund Processing**

- If original PayIn was viaÂ **voucher**:
    - Refund credited back to the same voucher code.
    - Customer can reuse the voucher for new purchases until balance depleted/expired.
- If original PayIn was viaÂ **MyNeosurf**:
    - Refund credited directly to the same MyNeosurf account (email).

**Step 5: Confirmation**

- Paysecure sends webhook:
    - `refund.paid`Â (with amount, transaction details),
    - orÂ `refund.error`Â (if failed)
- Merchant backend updates customer order/account.

:::tip ðŸ“Œ
- Refunds must always return to the **same source** (voucher/MyNeosurf).  
- Cannot redirect to a different voucher or email.  
- Expired/depleted vouchers may not accept refunds â†’ merchant should fallback to a payout via MyNeosurf.
