# Rule Engine

**Rule Engine User Manual**

**Overview**

The Rule Engine in Paysecure enables users to create and manage rule categories, set priorities, and define transaction routing logic. It allows dynamic rule-based transaction routing to specific Banks/MIDs based on predefined conditions. The system supports priority-based rule execution and error-driven cascading, optimizing transaction success rates. Users can modify, activate, or deactivate rules, ensuring efficient and secure payment processing.

**Accessing the Rule Engine**

1. **Login** to the Paysecure dashboard at [https://app.paysecure.net/login](https://app.paysecure.net/login).
2. On the left-hand panel, navigate to **Rule Engine**.

**Configuring Transaction Filters**

Users can select any bank and apply criteria such as:

- Minimum number of social site registrations (email-based verification).
- Allowed social sites.
- Whitelist checks.
- Minimum/maximum transaction amounts.
- Merchant permissions.

These filters define how the rule engine processes transactions.

**Cascading Logic**

- If a transaction fails, it can be rerouted based on error type.
- Cascading is applicable **only** between:
    - 2D to 2D MIDs.
    - 2D to 3D MIDs.
    - **Not supported from 3D to 2D/3D MIDs.**

**Managing Banks/MIDs**

- The **Bank/MID List** displays all active Banks/MIDs.
- Users can select:
    - **All MIDs**
    - **New MID (add manually)**
    - **Selected MIDs with weightage-based routing**

By configuring these settings, transactions will be directed to MIDs with higher weightage, optimizing approval rates.
