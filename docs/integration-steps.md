# Integration Steps

To start integrating, ensure you have merchant access to the admin portal and sandbox credentials.

## 1. Setup & Check Merchant Details
Verify your merchant details on the Merchant portal. Contact your client support executive if anomalies are detected. Start in sandbox mode and create:
- API Key
- Brand ID
- Webhook

## 2. Test in Sandbox Mode
Test the purchase flow using testing credentials:
- Card numbers: `4444 3333 2222 1111` or `5555 5555 5555 4444`
- Name: Any cardholder name
- Expiry Date: Any date >= current month/year
- CVC: `345`

## 3. Create & Test in Live Mode
Create the same items (API Key, Brand ID, Webhook) in live mode and test with small amounts.

## 4. Go Live!
Notify the team when ready to go live for final setup.
