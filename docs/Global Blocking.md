This module enables merchants to **block transactions** based on specific criteria to enhance security and prevent fraudulent activity. Merchants can block transactions originating from particular **MIDs, BINs, Cards, Customer Profiles, Countries**, and **IP addresses**.

### **Blocking Options:**

- **MID (Merchant ID)**:
    
    View all available MIDs under your white-label account. You can choose to **block or unblock** specific MIDs to prevent transactions through those IDs.
    
- **BIN (Bank Identification Number)**:
    
    Upload a list of BINs that should be blocked. Transactions originating from cards with these BINs will be rejected.
    
- **Card**:
    
    Upload specific card numbers you wish to block. This is useful for blacklisting known fraudulent cards.
    
- **Customer Profile**:
    
    Block transactions by entering specific **Customer IDs** or **email addresses** to prevent those users from making purchases.
    
- **Country**:
    
    Select and block transactions originating from specific countries, adding an extra layer of geographic security control.
    
- **IP Address**:
    
    Block one or more IP addresses to prevent transactions from suspicious or untrusted sources.
    

This granular control helps merchants protect their business from high-risk or fraudulent transaction attempts.
