# Cashier-APIs

### **Overview**

Paysecure Cashier is a unified payment management solution that connects with leading PSP and acquirers, offering merchants one convenient access point to simplify transaction processing and enhance efficiency.

To start the cashier system, a __payment session__ is initiated—a secure, temporary environment generated by our payment gateway. This session encapsulates all transaction details and state information before the cashier loads, overseeing the complete lifecycle of a payment attempt—from initial setup to final completion—ensuring every necessary detail is managed safely and consistently.
