## 3. API Keys

The API Keys module is crucial for authenticating requests to the <CompanyName/> API. For merchants under the whitle-lable merchant, they will see additional tabs on the dashboard to generate API Keys, Brand IDs and more.

### Functionality Overview

- **Auth Key (Bearer Token):**
    - Used in the request header for calling any <CompanyName/> API endpoint.

### Steps to Generate an API Key

1. **Access API Keys Module:**
    - Navigate to the ‚ÄúAPI Keys‚Äù section from the dashboard menu.
        
        ![Description](/img/Screenshot_2025-05-16_at_5.30.51_PM.png)
        
2. **Generate a New Key:**
    - Click on the ‚ÄúGenerate Key‚Äù button.
    - A modal window will open.
3. **Enter Key Details:**
    - **Title:**¬†Provide a descriptive title for the key (e.g., ‚ÄúProduction Key ‚Äì Website Integration‚Äù).
        
        ![Description](/img/Screenshot_2025-05-16_at_5.41.57_PM.png)
        
4. **Generate and Save:**
    - Click the ‚ÄúGenerate‚Äù button.
    - The generated key appears in the list with creation date and status.
5. **Usage:**
    - Include this key as a Bearer token in the header of every API call.
    - Example HTTP header:
        
        ```http
        Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
        ```

## 4. Brands

Certain <CompanyName/> API calls require a Brand ID, which uniquely identifies the merchant brand.

### How to Generate a Brand ID

1. **Access the Brands Section:**
    - Navigate to the ‚ÄúBrands‚Äù tab on the dashboard.
        
        ![Description](/img/Screenshot_2025-05-16_at_5.42.35_PM.png)
        
2. **Generate a New Brand ID:**
    - Click on ‚ÄúGenerate Brand‚Äù

        ![Description](/img/Screenshot_2025-05-16_at_5.43.51_PM.png)
        
3. **Confirmation:**
    - Once generated, the Brand ID is displayed and can be copied for use in API requests.

**Usage in API Requests:**

- The Brand ID must be included in the header or request parameters when calling most <CompanyName/> APIs.

## 5. Webhook Configuration

Webhooks enable real-time communication of transaction events from <CompanyName/> to your server.

![Description](/img/Screenshot_2025-05-16_at_5.46.24_PM.png)

### Overview

- **Purpose:**
    - Configure a URL to receive callback notifications for payment events.
- **Scope:**
    - Can be set individually for each payment method or for all methods simultaneously.

### Steps to Configure a Webhook

![Description](/img/Screenshot_2025-05-16_at_5.47.47_PM.png)

1. **Add a New Webhook:**
    - Click on the ‚ÄúNew Webhook‚Äù button.
2. **Provide Details:**
    - **Name:**¬†Give the webhook a descriptive name.
    - **Payment Method Selection:**
        - Choose a specific payment method or select ‚ÄúAll‚Äù for universal callbacks.
    - **Enter URL:**
        - Provide the callback URL where the event notifications will be sent.
    - **Select Event Triggers:**
        - Choose from a list of available events.
            - Note: Depending on the payment method, not all events may be available.
3. **Save Configuration:**
    - Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù to store the webhook settings.

### Event Trigger Options

The available events include:

- hold release
- payment in progress
- payment refund
- purchase cancelled
- purchase created
- purchase expired
- purchase failed
- purchase hold
- purchase overdue
- purchase paid
- refund in progress

*Important Note:*

<aside>
üóíÔ∏è

For purchase requests, if you set success and failure callback URLs directly in the request, they will override the ones configured in the dashboard. For payout events, callback URLs must be configured within the payout API itself and are not managed from the dashboard.

## 6. Public Key

The public key plays a crucial role in verifying the hash signature used to decrypt payload responses.

![Description](/img/Screenshot_2025-05-16_at_5.48.18_PM.png)

### How It Works

- **Purpose:**
    - The public key is used to decrypt the response payload and verify its integrity.

### Configuration

- **Access:**
    - The public key is displayed in the ‚ÄúPublic Key‚Äù section of the dashboard.
- **Usage in Transactions:**
    - It must be used in conjunction with the corresponding private key to validate that the data received from <CompanyName/> is untampered.

## 7. Settings

The Settings module allows merchants to fine-tune parameters for specific payment methods.

![Description](/img/Screenshot_2025-05-16_at_5.49.42_PM.png)

### Transaction Expiry Settings

- **Purpose:**
    - Set the expiry minutes for APMs (Alternative Payment Methods) that support an expiry configuration.
- **How It Works:**
    - The¬†`purchase.expireInMin`¬†parameter can be passed in the API request.
        - If provided, this parameter takes precedence over the dashboard‚Äôs default settings.
    - **Functionality:**
        - Defines the time window within which a customer must complete an Interac payment.
        - If the customer fails to complete payment within the configured window, the transaction status is automatically set to¬†**EXPIRED**.

### Considerations and Best Practices

- **Potential Inconsistencies:**
    - In some cases, a payment made after the expiry window might still succeed (e.g., if the customer‚Äôs bank processes the payment later), leading to discrepancies.
- **Recommendations:**
    - Set an appropriate expiry time and communicate clearly to customers the required payment window.
    - In the event of inconsistencies between <CompanyName/>‚Äôs records and the customer‚Äôs bank, reconciliation is performed during settlement.
